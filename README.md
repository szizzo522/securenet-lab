This repository is organized to document my hands‑on cybersecurity lab work in a clear, professional way.
 /screenshots

This folder contains visual proof of lab activity and exploitation, including:
	-	Nmap scans showing open ports
	-	Metasploit sessions
	-	Reverse shells
	-	Vulnerable web applications (DVWA)
	-	Successful exploits
	-	Privilege escalation
	-	Network layouts

These screenshots demonstrate that the attacks and analysis were performed in a real, functioning lab environment.

 /writeups

This folder contains detailed penetration‑testing reports for each vulnerable machine used in the lab.

Each write‑up includes:
	-	Target description
	-	Reconnaissance steps
	-	Exploitation method
	-	Commands used
	-	Vulnerabilities exploited
	-	How root or admin access was achieved

Example files:
	-	metasploitable.md
	-	dvwa.md
	-	vulnhub-*.md

 /tools

This folder contains:
	-	Custom scripts
	-	Notes on commands used
	-	Payloads or enumeration scripts
	-	Cheatsheets
	-	Configuration files

These tools support scanning, exploitation, and post‑exploitation tasks inside the lab.

 /network-diagram

This folder contains:
	-	Diagrams of the virtual lab network
	-	IP address layouts
	-	VM connectivity
	-	How Kali communicates with vulnerable machines

This helps explain how the lab is structured and how traffic flows between systems.

 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a technical portfolio documenting my cybersecurity training and hands‑on experience with:
	-	Kali Linux
	-	Vulnerability scanning
	-	Exploitation
	-	Web application security
	-	Privilege escalation
	-	Network analysis

All systems tested are intentionally vulnerable and hosted in a safe, isolated environment.
